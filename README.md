# tetris clone

A plain Tetris clone made in C. Also it is my CS50 final project.
[Few more words](https://marcolucidi01.github.io/posts/a-tetris-clone.html) on my
site.

The library [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) is required. On
Debian (and I guess on Ubuntu and such):

```bash
# apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```

then:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MarcoLucidi01/tetris_clone.git
$ cd tetris_clone
tetris_clone$ make
tetris_clone$ ./tetris_clone  # enjoy!
```
